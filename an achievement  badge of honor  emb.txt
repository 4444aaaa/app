an achievement / badge of honor / emblem

tattoo

achievements / level up / ranks

'im proud of this / ' I achieved this'

if I had money - i'd definitely do something like this. this would make learning so much more fun.

merch. (shirts with like... logo achievements or something)

create a certain type of content in a certain format => you get a badge for it / stamp / certificate

im learning a class.

if // is a beginner spell. I create the logo for it. (like in WoW / wow macro or w.e)

thought: take it to real life -> create a 'spell manual' (print the logo icon, place it on the book)

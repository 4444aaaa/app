    ctrl h -> ctrl alt enter (replaces all instances)


i see days where i do 

1. Marketing
2. vim / Linux
3. js

another day

1. Networking
2. app
3. html

it would be great if they could all somehow relate to one another (thought)

everything that i do can bounce off each other

because

i can literally learn 3 things at once

have a website (passively)

slowly grow backlinks over these 4 years

while I do this, 

thought:

    if i were to have a website over these 4 years (practicing SEO, backlinks, etc... what would it be?)

thought was:

    study 4 years and make money from creating websites for people


thought:

    create a website that melbournians can search up (eg. pollenforecast) and point it to my website

thought: matcha website -> a 'website agency' website


website:

    - resource + content hub
    - listing local businesses / niche directory
    - tools, template, free resources
    - blog posts that have solved problems
    - portfolio / case study site


thought:

what would be the smartest thing to do?

    - post things on YouTube
    - make sure they hit.


i liked the task system but the one i was working in put me in a box

a part of me feels like i shouldnt be speeding through things
a part of me feels like i should

it feels like freecodecamp atm explains the why

i sort of dont feel like learning the why because of war

i just want to fucking do it

but learning the why is important... but when im calm

implement h2 margins instead of <br>


split the box classes accordingly to their topics (thought, bad, task)

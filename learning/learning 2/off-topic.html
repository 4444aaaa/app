i always feel fucking amazing after feeling fucking shit as fuck when i do my fucking notes and application

so


i think it would be fucking amazing if i fucking do my notes and application first before i fucken go outside and do shit
so i might need to fucking work on that


when i feel dead / overworked / slaughtered / murdered = do much less of what u did last time (i got murdered = in the morning the day after,
only took toothpaste and brush and floss and one towl and undies (shouldnt even taken the undies) and thats it)

everyday is getting me closer to jpn regardless of wht i do (even rest)

diff metric is needed

does this task get me closer to earning more money?
does this task bring me further away?

how to get to jpn?

course brings me closer to jpn
money brings me closer to jpn
love brings me closer to jpn


need a category for 'not coming'

metric: does this get me closer to getting out of this house? (this brings strong emotions)

what does this mean?

    renting another place + renting this room

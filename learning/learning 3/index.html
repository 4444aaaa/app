            If you want to improve in a topic / task (resistance) = do the same task, next day in the morning.
            <br><br>
            Eg.
            <br><br>
            You did yoga for 7:34 minutes today, in the afternoon.
            <br><br>
            For some reason, you want to increase this to 10 minutes.
            <br><br>
            Do yoga tomorrow in the morning, first thing.
            <br><br>
            You might run into issues doing this type of thing everyday with different tasks.

            Too much resistance might not be good.
